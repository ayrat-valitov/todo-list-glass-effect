***Glassmorphism Todo List***

This is my first project where I’m practicing core Web Development skills. The main goal was to implement a modern Glassmorphism design using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on clean layout and responsiveness.

** Tech Stack **

1) HTML5;
2) CSS3;
3) JS (next ver.).

** Progress **

[x] Clean semantic HTML code.
[x] Implemented frosted glass effect using backdrop-filter.
[x] Responsive on mobile version
[x] Hover/active effects and animated floating labels. 

**What would you like to make in future versions?

[] DOM manipulation for adding/deleting tasks (JS).
[] Real-time filtering system (Input search) (JS).
[] Add localStorage (JS)
[] limiting text in fields (CSS)
